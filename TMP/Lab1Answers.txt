1) What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? 
   Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin 
   scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

Exponential Scheduler:

Advantages:

-> Scheduling is purely based on randomly generated values in an exponential distribution.
-> Starvation does not occur because the probability of choosing low priority process is high.
-> We have the control over randomly generated values by changing LAMDA.

Disadvantages:

-> The probabality of choosing a process with highest priority decreases as priority increases due to which
   starvation may occur.
-> LAMDA value must be chosen appropriately.


Linux Scheduler:

Advantages:

-> Starvation does not occur in this type of scheduling policy as each and every process executes it's quantum time in an epoch.
-> Process are scheduled based on goodness value, the higher the goodness value the more the probability to get hold of CPU resources.
-> The process which did not execute it's quantum completely is given higher priority in the next epoch.

Disadvantages:

-> The time complexity to calculate goodness,quantum,counter for each process in the process list is very high.
-> Additional computing overhead might be required.
-> Cannot be implemented, as higher priority process must wait until next epoch.

Round Robin policy in default XINU scheduler:

Advantages:

-> Each and every process has an equal probablity to be scheduled.
-> The highest priority process is scheduled at the beginning.
-> Quicker and efficient algorithm as there are no computations involved and better response time.

Disadvantages:

-> Lower priority process might starve until higher priority process gets scheduled.
-> Performance depends on the time quantum, if the value is too slow and result in slower execution.

2) Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

Exponential Scheduler:

-> The NULL process is scheduled only if there aren't any process in the ready queue.

Linux Scheduler :

-> The NULL process is only allowed to scheduled to run in an EPOCH if there are no process in ready queue for epoch.

Default XINU Scheduler:

-> The NULL process is scheduled if there aren't any process in the ready queue.
